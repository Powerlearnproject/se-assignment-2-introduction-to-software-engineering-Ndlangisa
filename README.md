# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in order to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. The difference is the scope between the two. traditional programming has a greater scope compared to software engineering eg planning, design,management and maintenance
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.  it is made up of six phases they are requirements which is gathering and recording the needs of the client, .Design based on the requirements and guided by the analysis the programme is designed to met the needs. Implementation this is the actual coding of the programme. Testing is the search for bugs in the programming. Deployment is the release of the programme to the users. Finally Maintainance this is to provide support to the user to ensure effective operation of the programme and its systems.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Waterfall model is a form of software development where task are completed one after the other, with one not being done unless the previous one is done. This works for small and project that dont have a very short deadline since the risk of delay is high and is a less complicated set up for developing software. Agile has multiple tasks being executed in ordeto develop software. It is very dynamic and can be complex. It allows easier navigation when it comes to delays and short time frames since multiple tasks can be done at once. It also involves iteration sections can be designed while other parts are being tested and may take certain programmes back to the drawing board or move on to the next stage
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. This is the process of getting the the needs of the client. A research may be required to understand how to best meet the needs and fully understand the needs
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? The project manager is there to ensure the project runs on schedule, on budget and all the requirements of the client are met.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. MAintainence is the upkeep of the programme by bringing up todate to current treats ea identified bugs in the programme that bad actors are exploiting or could exploit as  identified by white hat hackers. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? It is the way to extend the lifespan of the product and increase customer satisfaction by changing things like ease of access, aligning with changing legal requirements eg changing of gambling zoning or definition meaning gambling sites need to adapt
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? Prompting not done propperly may skew the response that AI gives and provide bias in the data. The training data for the AI needs to be checked for bias since this can negetively affect the user of the AI product. an example would be racial profiling from misleading data set that the AI learned fromHow can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? They need to work in an unbias way and constaly be on the look out for bias as it may negetively impact the user.
Submission Guidelines:
